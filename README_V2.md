# Integration V2 (post-cleanup)

The integration test has been split into components & refactored to make this repo
both easier to use and more modular.  It retains all the old functionality, 
with some helpful additions.

## Repo structure
```
 - integration/
 -- run.sh  # Basic integration runner
 -- start.sh    # More advanced runner for continuous/simultanious testing
 -- stop.sh     # Cleanup for start.sh
 -- tests/  # Tests directory contains individual tests which can be run by the top level scripts
 --- basice2e_local # Test names correspond to the directory name
 ---- run.sh    # Each test must contain a run.sh script and clients.goldoutput directory
 ---- clients.goldoutput/
 --- channels
 --- ...
 -- network/    # This network package is used across all tests
 --- network.sh # network and/or cleanup files should be sourced into files as always
 --- cleanup.sh
 --- [network configs]
 -- results/    # This is generated by running tests, and is not in source control
 --- network    # Local network outputs to results/network
 --- basice2e_local
 ---- clients/  # Raw client outputs for this test
 ---- clients-cleaned/  # Cleaned client outputs for this test
 ---- testout.txt   # Raw console output for this test
 --- ...    # Results contains directories of client logs for each test run
 --- testreport.txt
```

## Running integration tests

Integration tests can be run as they always have been, with some small changes.  
All testing must now run through `run.sh` in the root directory.  By default,
the script will run all tests in sequence.  it accepts an optional argument for
envronment [mainnet|devnet|protonet].  It supports an additional named argument 
for running single tests or subsets as well, `--run [testname]`.  Use `run.sh help` 
for more information on the usage.  

## Advanced integration testing

Also included in the repo are the scripts `start.sh` and `stop.sh`.  These can 
be used to the same effect as the single runner, with some notable differences.  
Running `start.sh` will check for a live network in the expected location, and
will connect to it if found.  This is somewhat intelligent, but not well tested yet.
It will not shut down the network when the test is finished, leaving it active 
for other local testing if needed.  To shut down the network, use the `stop.sh`
script.  The help commands on each script contain more detailed information on 
usage.

## Adding new tests

The generatePackage.py script has been deprecated by this update.  While it may
be updated in the future, adding new tests is not nearly so complicated anymore.
A template for run.sh can be found in `gen/`.  To create a new test, add a directory
to `tests/` with the desired test name.  Copy the `run.sh` file from `gen/`, and
add a `clients.goldoutput/` directory to your new test package.  You can now 
add test code to `tests/{yournewtest}/run.sh`, and run it using the `--run` argument
with `run.sh` in the root directory.  New tests must be separately added to the 
list in `run.sh` to be run as part of the full suite.  Additionally, a new step
must be added to the `.gitlab_ci` file for it to run as part of continuous integration.
An example for this can be found below:
```yaml
{ your_test_name_here }:
  stage: tests
  image: $DOCKER_IMAGE
  script:
    - mkdir -p ~/.elixxir
    - echo $PWD
    - rm -fr results
    - ./run.sh --run { your_test_name_here }
  artifacts:
    when: always
    expire_in: '1 day'
    paths:
      - results/
      - bin/

```

## Planned upgrades

Leaving this section as a note for the future, some things that are out of scope
for the time being but would improve the quality of this repo.

- Finish splitting up basice2e
- bring back generatePackage.py?  (may not be needed, this is fairly easy now)
- CI testing using single network
- Suppress individual test output since this now goes to a file, add verbose flag for users who want the old behavior
- Top-level script code review
  - Potential rewrite/wrapper in python?
